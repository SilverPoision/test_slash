You can find this app hosted here:

https://murmuring-coast-29976.herokuapp.com/

I have exposed endpoints for signup and login here:

https://murmuring-coast-29976.herokuapp.com/api/user/signup
https://murmuring-coast-29976.herokuapp.com/api/user/login

So if you want to signup then send a request with body with json like this.

```
{
    "email": "piyush1671@gmail.com",
    "password": "Silver@1671"
}
```

For admin access just login with this credentials.

```
Email: piyush1671@gmail.com
Password: Silver@1022
```
